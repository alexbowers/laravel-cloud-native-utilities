# Cloud Native Utilities for Laravel

This library contains a collection of resources we use at Jobilla for our Laravel
microservices. It's aimed at minimising the friction of setting up a new service
by providing sensible defaults from the get-go.

## What you get out of the box

- standardised metrics output in Prometheus format on `/metrics`
- JSON-formatted logs with minimal setup
